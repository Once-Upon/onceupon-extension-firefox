This extension will redirect you from Etherscan to Once Upon for any transaction, block, or address.

4. Open Firefox.
5. Type `about:debugging` in the URL bar and click return.
6. Click "This Firefox" in the left nav bar.
7. Make sure "Temporary Extensions" is expanded and click the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
8. Navigate to the `onceupon-extension-firefox` folder (from the first 3 steps) and select the manifest.json file.
